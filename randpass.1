.SH NAME
randpass \- random password generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B randpass
.RI [ \-a ]
.RI [ \-u ]
.RI [ \-n\ count ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is a random password generator for Linux
systems.  When invoked, it produces a single
randomly-generated password on standard output.
By default, passwords may contain uppercase and lowercase
ASCII letters, ASCII numerals, and ASCII punctuation
characters.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I \-a
Alphanumeric passwords only, omitting punctuation characters.
.TP
.I \-u
By default,
.I randpass
will obtain a random number from
.IR /dev/random .
With this flag, it will instead use
.IR /dev/urandom .
This will theoretically decrease the security
of the generated password, but will practically make
it possible to invoke
.I randpass
many times in quick succession without it hanging until
the random number generator's entropy pool refills.
.TP
.I \-n count
Generate a password of length
.IR count .
